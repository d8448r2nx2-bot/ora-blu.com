          "ORA BLU" is the Italian term for the blue hour, the moment at dawn or dusk when the
          sun is just as far below the horizon, that the world is bathed in a soft, blue light.
          The Berlin-based Newcomerband ORA BLU named itself after this phase of the day,
          matching their dreamy, danceable sound.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-text">
          The three band members Marlene (vocals and bass), Kai (vocals and guitar) and Henrik
          (drums and production) combine Pop, Hip-Hop, Funk and R'n'B with Indiemusic-
          Elements. Like this, a unique soundscape is created which invites you to dance to it,
          groove with it and feel it overall.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-text">
          ORA BLU provides the proof, that different styles and approaches don't have to result in
          differences, but can actually complement each other. With a sure instinct, you can create
          something completely new out of diversity. And so ORA BLU might sound a bit like MY
          BABY, occasionally like Bonobo or Chet Faker – but mostly like their completely own
          creation of sound and style.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-text">
          The newcomers are facing an exciting future, that’s for sure. As listeners, we can look
          forward to road trips with suitable background music, moody concert experiences and
          mild summer nights, accompanied by the versatile sound of ORA BLU.

          ORA BLU is a Berlin-based alt-pop band inspired by "ora blu," the
Italian term for the mystical "blue hour" — that brief time at dawn
and dusk when the world is washed in soft, atmospheric blue light.
This name perfectly captures their music: dreamy, rhythmic, and
cinematic, blending genres to create a soundscape that is as
dynamic as it is immersive.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-text">
          Formed by Henrik (drums/production), Marlene (vocals/bass), and
Kai (vocals/guitar), ORA BLU originated in 2022 after the three met
at university and found common ground in their diverse musical
influences. Their tracks layer funky basslines, ambient guitars, and
electro- and RnB-infused drum beats, weaving elements of indie-
pop, R&B, and funk into an eclectic yet cohesive sound.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-text">
          Listening to ORA BLU feels like a road trip at dawn, an evening on a
city rooftop, or a warm summer night in Berlin. Their music draws
inspiration from artists like Khruangbin, Jorja Smith, Bonobo, Tom
Misch, FKJ and Men I Trust, yet the result is distinctively their own.
ORA BLU offers an invitation into a world where styles collide
beautifully, delivering performances that feel as immersive and
memorable as the blue hour itself.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-text">
         Their self-titled debut album, releasing in full by June 2026, invites
into a space of honesty and vulnerability. Like the blue hour, it
dwells in the in-between—light and dark, day and night—
celebrating life’s many facets amid an increasingly overwhelming world.

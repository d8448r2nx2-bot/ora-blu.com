ORA BLU Press Release / Artist Bio EN

"ORA BLU" is the Italian term for the blue hour, the moment at dawn or dusk when the
sun is just as far below the horizon, that the world is bathed in a soft, blue light.
The Berlin-based Newcomerband ORA BLU named itself after this phase of the day,
matching their dreamy, danceable sound.

The three band members Marlene (vocals and bass), Kai (vocals and guitar) and Henrik
(drums and production) combine Pop, Hip-Hop, Funk and R'n'B with Indiemusic-
Elements. Like this, a unique soundscape is created which invites you to dance to it,
groove with it and feel it overall.

Kai's distinctive and emotional voice complements Marlene's warm vocals, guitar solos
and driving Basslines are surrounded by perfectly formed drum elements.
The result is a tonal roadtrip at dawn, a humming evening on a rooftop at twilight or the
sound of a warm summernight between trees.

ORA BLU provides the proof, that different styles and approaches don't have to result in
differences, but can actually complement each other. With a sure instinct, you can create
something completely new out of diversity. And so ORA BLU might sound a bit like MY
BABY, occasionally like Bonobo or Chet Faker – but mostly like their completely own
creation of sound and style.

In 2016, the three musicians got to know each other in their first semesters on the
hallways of Berlins SRH School of Popular Arts. Kai, Marlene and Henrik have studied
music production and popular music together, and tried out a wide variety of
constellations, styles and projects over the past few years.

Sometimes it was Kai who invited multi-instrumentalist Marlene and the drummer/
producer to a festival stage with his solo project, sometimes it was Henrik who involved
the singer, songwriter and guitarist Kai and Marlene in his Berlin-based studio project
TOLLKÜHN PRODUCTIONS.

In 2021, in the midst of the corona pandemic and after graduating with a bachelor’s
degree, the time had finally come and the three musicians merged their styles and
experiences and started something new: ORA BLU.

The next year is gonna be exciting for the newcomer band; An EP is waiting to be
released and its first single „On Repeat“ (including a music video), has already been
released on the 15th of July.

Four more single-releases are planned and the trio can be experienced live at this year’s
MIT DIR Festival.

The newcomers are facing an exciting future, that’s for sure. As listeners, we can look
forward to road trips with suitable background music, moody concert experiences and
mild summer nights, accompanied by the versatile sound of ORA BLU.

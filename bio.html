      ORA BLU Press Release / Artist Bio EN<br><br>

      "ORA BLU" is the Italian term for the blue hour, the moment at dawn or dusk when the
      sun is just as far below the horizon, that the world is bathed in a soft, blue light.<br><br>

      The Berlin-based Newcomerband ORA BLU named itself after this phase of the day,
      matching their dreamy, danceable sound.<br><br>

      The three band members Marlene (vocals and bass), Kai (vocals and guitar) and Henrik
      (drums and production) combine Pop, Hip-Hop, Funk and R'n'B with Indiemusic-Elements.
      Like this, a unique soundscape is created which invites you to dance to it, groove with it
      and feel it overall.<br><br>

      Kai's distinctive and emotional voice complements Marlene's warm vocals, guitar solos
      and driving Basslines are surrounded by perfectly formed drum elements. The result is a
      tonal roadtrip at dawn, a humming evening on a rooftop at twilight or the sound of a warm
      summernight between trees.<br><br>

      ORA BLU provides the proof, that different styles and approaches don't have to result in
      differences, but can actually complement each other. With a sure instinct, you can create
      something completely new out of diversity.<br><br>

      In 2016, the three musicians got to know each other in their first semesters on the
      hallways of Berlins SRH School of Popular Arts…<br><br>

      The newcomers are facing an exciting future, that’s for sure. As listeners, we can look
      forward to road trips with suitable background music, moody concert experiences and
      mild summer nights, accompanied by the versatile sound of ORA BLU.<br><br>
